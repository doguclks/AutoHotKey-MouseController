Shortcuts:

Ctrl + Alt + M = Toggle between Mouse ↔ Keyboard mode

W = Move mouse up

S = Move mouse down

A = Move mouse left

D = Move mouse right

J = Left click

K = Right click

L = Double click

I = Middle click (When held down → activates Scroll Mode, allowing WASD to scroll instead of move)

U = Drag & Drop mode

First press: holds down the left mouse button (drag starts).

Press again: releases the left mouse button (drag ends).

Works as a toggle for easier drag-and-drop operations.

Additional Notes

Scroll Mode (I key held down)
While holding I, WASD no longer moves the cursor but instead performs scrolling:

W = Scroll Up

S = Scroll Down

A = Scroll Left

D = Scroll Right

Dual monitor usage
Currently, there are some issues when using the script with multiple monitors (e.g., cursor getting stuck when moving across screens).
This will be addressed in future updates.
